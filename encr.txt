How The Cryptosystem Works
====
Input:
-A Bytearray from an arbitary file
-A Passphrase

1.
A Hash for the passphrase is generated. Currently MD5, RIPEMD160, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA 512 are possible because they are a part of the System.Security.Cryptography namespace, but others might be added.

2.
A Seed is chosen. Currently a Passphrase to byte to integer conversion. !!!MIGHT CHANGE!!!

3.
The Bytearray is split into chunks of 1 hash length.
3.1
With each step, a byte from the hash is added to the seed
3.2
The seed is hashed. This should create enough enthropy to make sure no chunk is transformed using the same key.
3.3
The key and the chunk are added bit by bit without carryover.
3.4
The result chunk is appended to the output array

4.
The output array can be stored/transmitted.
